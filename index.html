          <p1>Hello! This website is going to have informative content from a paper that I have previously written. To give some context, the paper is about different archeaology projects. Hope you enjoy! </p1><br />
    <p style="text-indent: 5em;">The overall goal of the Mosfell Archaeological Project is to obtain information about the prehistory and early history of the Mosfell region in southwestern Iceland. It is an international research project set out to develop an understanding of human adaptation and environmental change in the Mosfell region beginning in the Viking Age. The project is trying to obtain as much information as possible before it is ultimately lost forever. It is difficult to determine when this research will be concluded since new locations could be discovered at anytime. Nothing is mentioned that protects the Mosfell Valley, but it can be assumed that individual sites within the valley would have some oversight depending on the factors involved. The project’s data is presented in summarizations of the seasons of fieldwork and any note-worthy finds.  The Mosfell Project has many publications which include research articles, books, and specialist reports. The fieldwork, which is organized by year, is available online and a list of project publications is provided.<s>The community outreach has been extremely important to the development of the project.</s> With the help of the local town of Mosfellsbær, international researchers and other notable organizations located in Iceland, the participants have helped the researchers discover new locations in which to study and preserve the memories of older generations. Information about the involvement of students or volunteers is not apparent for this project, however there is a CMRS Ahmanson Conference at the University of California Los Angeles. The conference brings scholars and researchers together from many top nations to discuss the study in the Mosfell Valley. The website itself seems to be directed to researchers and enthusiasts alike who want information about the study. The purpose is to present the data found in a formal and fun way to appeal to varying levels of education while also giving relevant information to someone in the field of archaeology. This developing study is important because it helps us understand the history of the native people of the Mosfell Valley and those civilizations who were connected to the region.
